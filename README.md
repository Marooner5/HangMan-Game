# HangMan-Game
============

A simple hangman game that I am making to stay fresh with python. As of this commit I have made it fully functional.
All that is yet to do is test for bugs.

 Future Plans: 
 ------------
- Add a scoring system in (possibly matched with the amount of time played)
- Be able to guess the full word for more points!
- Make into a web application and put on my website, for testing of course.
- This will also make the GUI (as of now there really isn't one) much more appealing.



As you will later see I am also doing these same
projects in Java, Swift, C, C++, and Ruby.
